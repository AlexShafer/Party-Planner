**To Repo:** https://github.com/KeithBillings/Party-Planner


## Description: 

Based on "The Office" theme, this is a fun, web based application to record, retrieve, and display information required to plan and host a great party. Inputs will be gathered from the user and added to a unique event page with details about the event: Name of Event, Description, Location/Venue, Date and Time. An interactive map will be present on the event page as well as an interactive message board for guests to post information about the party or send a notice to the host. Users will be able to add, edit, and update the event details and guest list information as needed and post to the event page. Users can search for their events as well.

Users can add, edit, and modify event details and guests list. Guests can post messages on a message board.
